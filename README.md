eden -- (Eden - en(o)de - Node)
===============================


SYNOPSIS
--------

<BR/>

**Ephemeris on Node**

_O, eden before no node!_<br/>
_O, node after no eden!_<br/>
_O, this ephemeris on node is!_<br/>


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Try the eden(1) command.
So far it's just a tool for using the ephemeris(3) library from a shell.


INSTALL
-------

With the [npm](http://npmjs.org/) prerequisite, do:

    npm install -g eden

The `-g` for global, means `eden` can be run
regardless of what the current directory is.

In order to have a fully-enabled ephemeris you should `npm install -g precious`.
Or else `cake install` would get eden all set-up for development too.  Make sure
to check its licensing, which varies according to use.
