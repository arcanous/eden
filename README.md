# eden -- (Eden - en(o)de - Node)


## SYNOPSIS

_eden before no node_<br/>
_node after no eden_<br/>
_this **ephemeris on node** is_<br/>


## DESCRIPTION

Try the eden(1) command.
So far it's just a tool for using the ephemeris(3) library from a shell.


## INSTALL

With the [npm](http://npmjs.org/) prerequisite, do:

    npm install -g eden

The `-g` for global, means `eden` can be run
regardless of what the current directory is.

In order to have a fully-enabled ephemeris you should `npm install -g precious`.
Or else `cake install` would get eden all set-up for development too.  Make sure
to check its licensing, which varies according to use.
