# Eden -> en(o)de <- eNode

_O, eden before no node!_<br/>
_O, node after no eden!_<br/>
_O, sweet this ephemeris on node is!_<br/>

Q: Ok, we're humans, what's so sweet about this?<br/>
A: Somewhat logical: _sweet_ minus _e.t._ (not for extra-terrestrials) equals _swe_ (a.k.a. Swiss Ephemeris)

Q: We've heard that life in Eden was sweet, what about Node?<br/>
A: Spare the O, try it out, many people think [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) is pretty sweet, and that's no anagram.
