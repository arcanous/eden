Thanks for installing Eden.

Do npm-install for the rest of the node_modules (due to .gitignore).

For the time being, install pyswisseph <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyswisseph/> from source.

There is also a <http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML/> dependency (that should go away some day).

Read LICENSE (full copy found in swe/src) before use.
